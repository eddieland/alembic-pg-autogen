## Why

The comparator, canonicalization, and render modules currently use hand-rolled regex patterns to parse DDL identity,
inject `OR REPLACE`, and construct DROP statements. These regexes are fragile — they break on quoted identifiers,
dollar-quoted bodies containing SQL keywords, and multiline DDL. The `postgast` library provides AST-level parsing via
`libpg_query`, making all DDL manipulation correct by construction.

## What Changes

- Add `postgast` as a required runtime dependency alongside `alembic` and `sqlalchemy>=2`.
- Replace regex-based function identity extraction (`_FUNCTION_RE`, `_CREATE_FUNCTION_RE`) with
  `postgast.extract_function_identity()`.
- Replace regex-based trigger identity extraction (`_TRIGGER_RE`, `_CREATE_TRIGGER_RE`) with
  `postgast.extract_trigger_identity()`.
- Replace regex-based `OR REPLACE` injection (`_CREATE_OR_REPLACE_RE`) with `postgast.ensure_or_replace()`.
- Replace per-type DROP statement string interpolation with `postgast.to_drop()`.
- Remove all DDL-related `re.compile` patterns and the `_dequote_ident()` helper.
- **BREAKING**: `postgast` becomes a mandatory transitive dependency (no regex fallback path).

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `ddl-parsing`: AST-based DDL parsing, identity extraction, syntactic rewriting, and DROP generation via postgast.

### Modified Capabilities

- `canonicalization`: DDL strings are now parsed and transformed (OR REPLACE injection) before savepoint execution,
  superseding the previous "pass-through without transformation" requirement.
- `alembic-render`: DROP statements are now generated from full CREATE DDL via `postgast.to_drop()`, superseding
  per-field string interpolation.

## Non-goals

- Parsing DDL types beyond functions, triggers, and views (e.g., indexes, policies) — out of scope for this change.
- Making postgast optional or providing a regex fallback — postgast is a hard requirement.
- Changing the savepoint round-trip pattern in canonicalization — only the pre-execution transformation step changes.
- Altering the Alembic operations model or op registration — only the render layer's DROP generation changes.

## Impact

- **Dependencies**: `postgast` added to `[project.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Modules**: `_compare.py` (identity extraction), `_canonicalize.py` (OR REPLACE injection), render module (DROP
  generation) — all lose regex patterns and gain postgast calls.
- **Tests**: Existing identity-extraction and render tests need updating to expect postgast-derived output. New tests
  for edge cases (quoted identifiers, multiline DDL, dollar-quoted bodies).
- **Backwards compatibility**: Migration scripts generated by the new render layer are functionally equivalent but may
  differ cosmetically (e.g., PostgreSQL parser normalizes type names).
